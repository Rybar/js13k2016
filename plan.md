Super Glitch Box

    Super crate box clone with a twist
    
    game plays like cratebox, but crates are glitch. each collected glitch escalates the amount of glitch in-game, and randomizes the weapon
    
    amount of glitch will escalate with: ?
        each time you collect a glitch.

    score: how many glitch boxes collected + enemies killed
        
    Glitch visual effects and escalation:
        graphical errors (in order of escalation)
           background glitches -text renderer
           map glitches -from 3d array and text renderer
           text rendering glitches -text renderer
           sprite glitches -text renderer
           full screen bars/channel tearing
