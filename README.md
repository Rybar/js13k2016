# Super Glitch Box

An homage/clone of the amazing Super Crate Box, created for JS13k 2016.

Features:

* procedurally generated weapon behavior
* crazy particles
* Original music
* Stereo positional sounds


I have tested in Chrome, Opera and Firefox. Makes heavy use of the web audio API and canvas blend-modes. Some of the visuals had to be sacrificed for decent performance in Firefox, was unable to track down the exact cause before competition end.
