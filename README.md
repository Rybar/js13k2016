# js13k-toolkit
Starter repository for JS13k, a set of tools for developing a JS game and keeping it under 13kb

Run `grunt build` (or the `grunt watch` task) to build the project normally. Run `grunt build-compress` to uglify/minify
 all source js/css/html, which will then be compressed into a .zip file.
